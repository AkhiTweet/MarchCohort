        <h3 class="ingredients-title">Ingredient List</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients-list">
            <li>400g Strawberries</li>
            <li>100g Caster Sugar</li>
            <li>300ml Double Cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Step 1</h4>
                Choose four of the best-looking strawberries and set these aside to finish the mousse, then hull and roughly chop the rest. Tip these into a blender or food processor along with the sugar and blitz until smooth.</li>
            <li><h4>Step 2</h4>
                Whisk the cream to stiff peaks. Reserve roughly 4 tbsp of the strawberry purée in a small dish, then fold the rest through the whipped cream until it turns an even shade of pink. Divide the reserved purée between four small serving glasses or ramekins.</li>
            <li><h4>Step 3</h4>
                Spoon the mousse over the top, then chill for at least 1 hr. Will keep chilled for up to a day. Just before serving, halve the reserved strawberries and use these to decorate the mousse.</li>
        </ol>
